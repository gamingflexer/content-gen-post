IMAGE: PredianPredian launched a cloud-native artificial intelligence-powered inventory management solution. Offering predictive analytics and data mining through AI and machine learning, the company aims to transform how dealers manage their inventories, leading to higher profits and significantly reducing time to sales.Until now, the inventory management system was a division of Redline Automotive Merchandising. Now, under a new name, Predian will operate as a stand-alone business\\xa0directly supporting automotive dealerships and several lot service companies. Serving more than 1,000 franchise dealers and growing, with this move, Predian says it can turbocharge its innovation focus on inventory management and maintain a high level of service.Predian says three areas, all powered by AI and ML, set it apart from other inventory management systems: merchandising, predictive analytics, and business intelligence.Merchandising includes AI-guided photo capture and background removal, as well as AI-created VIN descriptions to ensure high-quality, consistent and compelling content on every piece of inventory.Predictive analytics enable dealers to make decisions based on what the market will look like in the future, all by leveraging advanced data modeling and machine learning to provide forward-looking guidance based on the VIN. Predian’s ValueVision uses predictive analytics to show a dealer what the retail price will be 30-, 60-, and 90 days out and incorporate that data into the inventory management strategy and pricing, and SmartTurn estimates turn time based on the set market price. That gives dealers the most information to make the right decision at the right time.Business intelligence offers dealers unlimited ability to combine and compare data based on the key drivers for the dealership’s performance.“Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will revolutionize how dealers manage their inventory,” said CEO Mike McGlade. “With Predian, dealers can dive into their inventory data to make better decisions and ensure they move vehicles quickly and profitably. Our goal was to make an easy-to-use solution that gives dealers access to every possible data point to make the right decisions for their dealership. It’s all about the data.”Predian can help determine the right inventory to stock and where to price it by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and customer behavior — preventing overstocking, reducing carrying costs, and minimizing risk. Predian is entirely cloud-native, enabling regular powerful and innovative updates.Predian has hired a team with inventory management and automotive experience. Merritt Critcher, who has decades of experience in inventory management at Dealertrack, DealerSocket and Solera, heads product development, and Stephen Batten, who has years of experience at Redline, Impel, Experian, and Reynolds and Reynolds, serves as the chief revenue officer - along with McGlade, who has served as CEO of Redline since 2019.Predian will debut its solutions at NADA in Las Vegas from Feb. 2\\xa0 to Feb. 4 at booth 7142N.

Photo ©GettyImages.com/D-KeineI am greatly saddened as I sit here pouring my thoughts into my keyboard. I’ve written numerous articles through the years detailing the fall of Cadillac, an American luxury icon. A voice inside my head keeps screaming, “Why?”I am about to rant an outpouring of my personal opinions, emotions, and perceptions as I have done so many times in years past. It isn’t always negative. I have owned nine Escalades and seven Chevrolet Corvettes. I was a cheerleader for the brand. And I still love General Motors; I am just enraged by their management.Read: Ziegler: Never Argue With Stupid PeopleWhen Mary Barra was appointed chairman and CEO of GM, I was ecstatic that they had selected a woman for that position. Four years later, I am scratching my head and saying, “Yes, but not that one.”Uh-oh! The angel on my right shoulder just said, “Ziegler, are you nuts? Talking bad about Mary Barra is sort of like slapping Mother Teresa.” And now the devil on my left shoulder is saying, “Go ahead, big boy. You never backed down from the truth before.”Wonder which angel I’ll listen to before I send this article to the editor? Since it’s only one man’s opinion, and I might be wrong, I’ll just go with my gut.Where Are Your Priorities?Mary has been quoted on more than one occasion as saying she has three priorities: stockholders, customers, and profits.Now wait a minute. What about the dealers?GM’s disdain for their dealers is evident in the fact that they no longer invite you to participate in monthly videoconference calls. The only time GM turns to their dealers is when they dig themselves into a hole so deep they need us to bail them out — which has happened repeatedly throughout history.In researching this article, I reflected back to the mid-’80s, when I was a manager at Potamkin Cadillac in Atlanta. I was privileged to experience the last glory days of the brand. The Potamkins were all about the luxurious and prestigious Cadillac brand. We had black tie champagne showcases and gave customers mink coats with every purchase. (Fur was not yet murder.)Read: Ziegler: Robbery in Progress. Somebody Call the Police!The cars had names like El Dorado, Fleetwood Brougham, Biarritz, and Seville. People knew the cars by name. It was everyone’s dream to own one someday. In his 1977 hit “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad,” Meat Loaf sang, “But there ain’t no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box.”Throughout the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s and into the mid-’80s, Cadillac was the gold standard. If you compared something to a Cadillac, it was the very best. All the movie stars and rock stars, from Bob Hope to Elvis Presley, owned at least one.Somehow, it took GM less than 30 years to totally destroy the brand. It’s sort of like my beloved Atlanta Falcons blowing a 28-point lead to lose the Super Bowl to the New England Patriots. What is even more incredible is that these people think they’re brilliant and can’t face up to or admit their own ineptitude and incompetence.Ziegler had high hopes for General Motors chairman and CEO Mary Barra, the first female chief executive of a major vehicle manufacturer, but now fears she has disappeared into a corporate culture that fails to prioritize dealers. Photo by Advanced Vehicle Technology via FlickrYou’re the WorstForget about the alleged bumbling incompetence of Rick Wagoner, under whose leadership GM pissed away $30 billion dollars in less than a decade. The bankruptcy was supposed to be a reboot, a second chance at redemption. And GM has engineered some brilliant advancements and put some great products on the street.So it’s not all bad. Except for Cadillac, where it is incredibly bad, the worst.At this year’s Detroit auto show, GM President Mark Reuss was quoted as saying, “We don’t have any chances left with taking Cadillac to a really new place. This is pretty much it.”Reuss is one of the few people left at GM that I like. But that fatalistic statement sounds like they might do away with the brand. Excuse me, Mark, but predictably moronic moves at the executive level are the only reason Cadillac is where it is.I’m not going to dedicate this article to beating you guys up over the Johann de Nysschen debacle. Mary Barra owns that one.I seem to remember Barra touting de Nysschen as the man who would spearhead the resurgence of the brand. All he needed was $12 billion and a plan.What did Johann achieve? Well, first of all he moved Cadillac headquarters from Detroit to Manhattan, which I perceived as a stupid vanity move to get away from daily scrutiny at RenCen. Coffee shot out of my nose when I read that news. And it wasn’t the last time.It was better than watching the Three Stooges on drugs. I could just picture de Nysschen saying ‘Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!’First of all, he gave every model in the lineup a new, meaningless, alphanumeric name, including a few that replaced names some previous fool had come up with. Then he noticed the SRX was Cadillac’s bestseller. So he killed that vehicle and gave the name to another.Then de Nysschen jumped on the subscription bandwagon. When “The Book” first launched, I was laughing uncontrollably. It was better than watching the Three Stooges on drugs. I could just picture de Nysschen saying “Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!”I wrote at least five articles in the magazines at the time, all describing how illogically stupid and disastrous their entire Cadillac brand strategy was. Go back and read those articles and you’ll see how deadly accurate everything I said was. History has once again vindicated me.There’s no disputing common sense when it’s well documented. That’s right — I said it, GM did it, and Mary owns it.Now here we are. They’re acting like Cadillac is down for the count. Does it have to be that way? Only until management can swallow some crow and lose the attitude. Your dealers can pull this ox out of the ditch. They have done it many times in the past.Read: Ziegler: How Can Geeks Be This Bad at Math?Bring Back Brand EquityCadillac’s situation is far from hopeless. For proof, look no further than Dearborn. Lincoln is experiencing a renaissance while you are trying to be something you are not and will never be.Cadillac is an American icon. Stop trying to be European. Nobody wants a cheap Audi knockoff. Your cars are ugly, they have no identity, and the quality is questionable.Maybe that’s just me, but I don’t think so. J.D. Power gave some of your 2019 models a dependability rating of 2.5 out of five, and some of the shop techs I’ve talked to would call that generous. And don’t blame it on dealer prep, and don’t bother getting all indignant and calling me a liar. You can tell the public whatever you want. We’re all car people here and we see it as it actually is.Have you seen the new XT6 SUV? GM propogandists say it will compete against the Audi Q7, BMW X5, and Lincoln’s Aviator. Well, I have seen the car, and to that I say, “In your dreams.”On a recent monthly call, a GM executive had the cajones to say that Cadillac was No. 1 in its class. Dealers were shaking their heads. What was this guy smoking? Are they delusional?It’s a thinly disguised secret that 54% of all Cadillac sales are coming from China. That’s a fragile hook to hang your hat on.Carl Sewell is the No. 1 premium Cadillac dealer in the country. He struggles to sell 100 units and has to give them away to hit the numbers.Of course, if I were the king of General Motors, the first thing I might do with Cadillac is to rebadge every car with exciting names that inspire consumers, names they can remember and identify with. We used to call this concept “brand equity.”A few years back, I met with Alan Mulally at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia shortly after he first became CEO of Ford. We were keynote speakers at a meeting of the Virginia and Maryland dealer associations. When I suggested to him that he should steer Ford away from alphanumeric names, he listened, and so have the current executives at Lincoln.It’s no secret that Ford’s luxury lineup is on fire, and they’ve got some really exciting product in the pipeline. The Lincoln Navigator is crushing the Escalade to the point where GM is throwing out huge amounts of dealer money to keep it above water. I predict the new Lincoln Aviator, for which Cadillac has no real category competitor, will hit them just as hard.Then, back to Cadillac, all of their eggs seem to be in one basket. It’s a thinly disguised secret that 54% of all Cadillac sales are coming from China. That’s a fragile hook to hang your hat on.Then there’s the issue with their misguided lack of marketing. The TV commercials with all the models and gangs driving their Cadillac XT4s are laughable. Nice try, but no comparison to the Escalade launch spots from 20 years ago.Read: Ziegler: Stupid Is as Stupid DoesDo You Not Sell Cadillacs? Dealers tell me that one of the stupidest things GM has done is forbidding them from listing their Cadillacs with the rest of their new vehicle inventory. Customers who don’t find a dealer’s separate Cadillac website can’t be blamed for assuming the dealer doesn’t sell them.Have you people had a brain cramp or something?Meanwhile, GM has stolen all of the profits out of the deals with a 3% markup and zero percent holdback. They expect you to lose money on the sale of the cars, which virtually all dealers do. You’re just trying to hit a number they made up (and keep moving) to try to get some kind of retro money.You can no longer afford professional, experienced salespeople, so you pay peanuts and get monkeys.When I was with a Cadillac dealer, we had a 28% markup to work with. We weren’t making a 28% profit, but we had margin to creatively structure the deals, get the banks to buy more, and give the customer a discount sufficient to make them feel good about the price.Can Cadillac resurge, revive, and flourish again? Of course. If I was in charge — really in charge — I could make it happen in less than a year.That being said, given the opportunity, I would have to pass. Right now, I have other priorities.Last month I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of esophageal cancer. The doctors and surgeons tell me the ordeal ahead will be everything I can handle — from chemo and radiation to an intensive, eight-hour surgery.I may be a lot less visible in the magazines and on social media in the months ahead. So wish me well, and as for you Cadillac dealers, please know I wrote this article out of love. I’ve dedicated my adult life to championing your causes and telling the factory things you couldn’t say yourself. I want the Cadillac brand to return to glory just as much as you do. I wish I could say the same for GM.

Dealers help OEMs create a loyal customer base and gain valuable referrals.The pandemic began to transform this long-standing partnership, as online automotive sales proved a viable way to sell cars. Now, some industry professionals believe OEMs will shift their sales strategy and start selling vehicles directly to consumers through online channels.No one really knows where OEMs are at in their trek to a new sales model; OEMs keep such strategies close to the vest, according to Erin Kerrigan, founder and managing director of Kerrigan Advisors. The aim of Kerrigan Advisors' first annual survey of OEM executives was to understand their perception of and their future plans for the franchise system.“These are people who are in the know but are rarely surveyed,” she says. “We thought getting their perspectives on how they thought the industry would change would be pretty insightful.”Turns out they were right. The buy-sell firm, well known for The Blue Sky Report, collected over 115 responses from OEM executives from December 2022 to May 2023 for this inaugural survey. Results depicted OEMs' outlook on dealer networks, profitability, inventory, and the agency model in the U.S.“We learned OEM executive thoughts on how they believed vehicles would be retailed, days’ supply, and more,” she says. “People say a lot of things, but are they really going to happen? Are OEMs going to be more disciplined with production going forward?”\\xa0OEM-Dealer PartnershipThe Kerrigan survey results affirmed how much OEM executives value their dealer networks, even as the auto retail model evolves.\\xa0Respondents indicated they view their dealers as partners in managing the industry’s evolution and see their customer-facing role as “critical to the automotive industry’s success,” reported “The Kerrigan OEM Survey 2023.”\\xa0The survey discovered just 22% of OEM executives believe an agency model of auto sales will come to the U.S. in the next five years, while 43% remained unsure and 35% did not believe the model will materialize in the U.S. “The divergent responses may reflect the legal barriers OEMs face due to protections provided by robust state franchise laws, which limit OEMs’ ability to sell directly to consumers,” the survey report noted.However, Kerrigan believes the data shows “we could see a change where there are more direct relations between the OEM and the dealer and the OEM and the consumer.”\\xa0To illustrate her point, she cites executives responses to a question on who will own customer data in five years. Here, 68% of OEM executives believe customer relationship data will be owned by both the OEM and the dealer, and 16% believe the OEM will have exclusive ownership versus 17% who believed dealers would.\\xa0“These responses make dealers a little skeptical of the OEMs plans for the future,” Kerrigan says. “All of a sudden OEMs are saying they want to own the customer data too and that they want dealers to share that information with them. This is why so many dealers are asking whether OEMs are trying to eventually sell direct to the consumer and crowd out the dealer.”\\xa0Concerns also mount as the industry sees the direct-to-consumer model work with other manufacturers. Tesla, for example, already sells directly to consumers with remarkable success. “The Tesla model has intrigued every OEM executive,” she says. “It has called into question the legacy dealer network for some OEMs. European luxury brands, like Mercedes-Benz, are also successfully trialing the agency model in Europe.”However, most OEMs, she says, also place a high premium on customer service, which is something franchise dealers do very well. Kerrigan says a shift to direct-to-consumer sales could put that at risk. “They risk customer relations not being where they need to be,” she says. “That’s why the dealer is so valuable to the OEM because they can make sure their customers get superb service.”For this reason, any shift toward a direct-to-consumer or hybrid model is one that must keep customer service top of mind, adds Jessica Stafford, senior vice president of Consumer Solutions for Cox Automotive. “We hear almost annually a buzz on whether OEMs will move more toward a direct-to-consumer model,” she says. “Each time this comes up, there is speculation about what will and won’t happen. Manufacturers are eager to drive amazing customer experiences and work with their dealer networks to bring that to life.”\\xa0Stafford points out Cox Automotive actively works with OEMs on their shopping experiences and how they partner with dealers to expose and merchandise both new and used inventory. “In my experience,” she says, “it’s the consumers' car-buying experience that OEMs are most interested in improving overall, not necessarily direct-to-consumer sales.”\\xa0Predictions on ProfitabilityAuto retailer profit per unit remains strong despite high transaction prices and high interest rates, increasing manufacturer incentives, and improved vehicle supply. In fact, JD Power and LMC Automotive research shows dealers received $3,692 per new vehicle unit in June 2023, which is almost three times the margin in December 2019.\\xa0And yet, the Kerrigan survey revealed that 69% of OEM executives expect dealership profitability to decline over the next 12 months, while 31% predicted profits would stay the same or increase.\\xa0“Interestingly, these declines are not driven by a reversion to pre-Covid new car margins,” the survey report noted. Only a slim majority of OEM execs said they believed margins would return to pre-Covid levels, while 74% expect new car margins to settle between pre-Covid and current levels in the next 12 months and 16% projected high margins would continue through 2023.\\xa0Still, margins will contract from some of the peak levels the industry has seen, according to Kerrigan, who attributes the shift to normalization of inventory levels.In the survey, OEM executives reported higher inventory turn rates on dealers’ lots over the next 20 months, which will cause lower day’s supply. In fact, 59% of those surveyed project days’ supply to be 30 days in the next 12 months and just 3%project a rate of 90 days or more.\\xa0“Most executives surveyed (61%) expect the ‘new normal’ for days' supply to settle in at 30 to 60 days, below the pre-Covid average of 60 to 90 days,” Kerrigan says.Kerrigan believes this shift is a byproduct of the win-win model of the entire industry experience with supply and demand during the pandemic. “OEMs spent less on incentives, so they were making more money and dealers were able to hold prices because they had less supply,” she says. “The industry got very well-schooled on the benefits of supply meeting demand. Before the pandemic, we had ample supply, which resulted in discounting and tremendous incentive spending, and it was a less profitable business model. The industry has realized it’s more profitable not to oversupply the network.”Of course, all bets are off with the Big Three striking in Detroit. At the onset of the strike, Ford reported around a two-month supply, Stellantis around a 100 days of supply, and GM around 46-51 days of supply. But those numbers won’t hold, and a loss of production could put upward pressure on prices, Kerrigan says.Brian Finkelmeyer, senior director of new car solutions at Cox Automotive, agrees saying the strike will “slow production and may impact sales in the coming months.”He writes in “The New-Vehicle Market Continues to Defy Gravity,” that “a strike will just be another obstacle that will help keep new car prices elevated, as supply shrinks in the face of strong demand. The automakers realize that a 15-million unit market is healthier than chasing 17-million units with excessive marketing costs and high incentives.”Focus on FacilitiesOEM responses came with one surprise, notes Kerrigan. Most OEM executives (52%) reported they believe facility requirements will remain largely the same over the next five years, while 32% noted they believe facility requirements will increase.The reason these responses were surprising is that they contrast with OEM expectations that dealers will maintain less inventory and have less staff as the industry moves toward non-negotiable pricing.\\xa0“Kerrigan Advisors believes these survey results are indicative of a business model that is in transition, with OEM views that are not always internally consistent and are evolving with the market,” the report noted.\\xa0Kerrigan finds the results surprising as the industry pivots toward an electrified future. She says, “Electric vehicles do not require as much service, so facilities should be smaller. And if OEMs are going to become more agency oriented and implement less price negotiation, the dealers will not require as much staff. Also, if there is less inventory, to me, that points to an industry that would require less brick-and-mortar investment.”When these trends are combined with OEM executives' thoughts on profitability, customer data, facilities and days' supply, the survey results show OEMs recognize the critical role of dealers in the auto retail space, Kerrigan adds.“While OEMs and dealers have differing perspectives on the path for electric vehicles, consumer data and facility requirements, mostly OEMs expect the dealer to remain a profitable piece of the auto retail puzzle,” the report concludes.\\xa0Kerrigan stresses the results show the OEM/dealer relationship will continue to evolve but highlight that “the relationship is on solid ground and well positioned to manage the evolution of U.S. auto retail.”\\xa0 Read more aboutKerrigan Advisors0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

The successor to hybrid vehicle Karma maker Fisker Automotive was founded in 2016.It said it won’t require dealers to change their existing stores, indicating it will partner with those who currently sell other brands. It plans to keep its Fisker Lounges in overseas markets to introduce the brand to consumers and capture sales leads to pass on to dealers.The company said it’s switching to dealership sales to “align with its asset light business model” and to scale for “significant acceleration” of Ocean deliveries and “higher volume production of future models.”Fisker has planned to produce three EV models designed by co-founder Henrik Fisker.The company said it will operate on a hybrid sales model in Europe, with continued direct sales and plans to also add about 50 sales and distribution partners.It said the shift will help it meet “increasing demand” for its vehicles.LEARN MORE: EV Startups on Shaky Ground Read more aboutElectric VehiclesstartupsAbout the authorStaff WriterEditorialView Bio0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

Power.\\xa0According to the findings, tire repair and replacement needs for EVs trend higher than those of internal combustion engine vehicles. Consider the following comparisons between EVs and ICE vehicle repair needs:49% vs. 28% for tire maintenance41% vs. 12 % for tire repair34% vs. 21% for tire replacementKevin Fitzpatrick owned a repair shop for about 20 years before becoming senior vice president with Opus IVS, His brother still owns a couple of shops on Long Island, N.Y. He says he believes EVs’ repair needs present an opportunity for service shops that get ready for the repairs.\\xa0“Electric vehicles are not magic in any shape or form. They use a lot of the same electronics as ICE vehicles,” he says. “But they weigh about 1,500 pounds on average, which is much heavier than an ICE vehicle, so they eat up suspension components, tires and more. There is plenty of service work to do on EVs, but you need to be trained and fully understand what you’re working on.”\\xa0Customer DissatisfactionBefore moving toward EV technology, service operations must first address customer dissatisfaction. According to the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Aftermarket Service Index Study, overall satisfaction declined year-over-year in three segments:\\xa0Quick oil changesFull-service maintenance and repairTire replacementService advisers also received poor marks, customers noting increased wait times and a lack of helpful advice and courtesy.Fitzpatrick said he believes there are three reasons for increasing dissatisfaction among customers over the last 12 to 18 months. First, today’s customers have extremely high expectations. Then there are supply chain issues, causing customers to wait months for parts. Third is the complexity of today’s vehicles.“A lot of technicians and shops are not getting involved in the late-model stuff,” he says. “This means customers are waiting longer for repair services. If you have a newer vehicle, you might be looking at a three-week backlog at a franchise dealership.”Keeping up With TechThe research identified keeping pace with vehicle technology as a way for service operations to improve customer service. Fitzpatrick said the ever-evolving technology of today’s vehicles makes that task challenging.\\xa0“It is difficult to keep up with technology changes, and there is a cost in both money and time,” he says. “You have to give up your technicians to send them to training. When you’re behind already, that becomes very difficult.”Training provided by after-market companies, such as PA Advanced Auto Parts or OPUS IVS, can get technicians up to speed. Dealer-level and OEM level training is also available. “But as more and more technology come out, training is an ongoing issue,” he says.There are expenses associated with both education and required tooling. A franchise dealership may be able to take that on, but these costs can be difficult for independent shops to absorb.\\xa0EVs further ratchet up training needs. The number of EV models is expected to double by 2024, giving EV shoppers over 130 models to choose from, according to\\xa0Visual Capitalist.“Training is going to be a job in and of itself,” he says. “The good technicians are fully aware of the commitment they are making to stay on top of the repair needs of EVs. A lot of these techs are working eight to 10 hours in the shop, then going home and training for another three hours on nights and weekends.”\\xa0But it’s a commitment companies who want to stay in business will need to make. “You don’t ever want to lose a customer. It’s 10 times more expensive to onboard a new customer than it is to keep an existing one,” he says. “But that existing customer with an ICE vehicle today, may purchase a Tesla tomorrow. If you want to keep that customer, you need to be prepared to work on that vehicle.”\\xa0Safety ConcernsThe average EV operates on 400 volts, which can pose a safety risk, according to Fitzpatrick.The voltage is high enough to kill a human being. Besides training to work with that kind of voltage, technicians need thick specialty gloves and Personal Protective Equipment. And the entire staff needs to be trained on what to do should a technician get electrocuted.\\xa0“EVs can be quite dangerous to work on,” he says. “No one should attempt to work on these vehicles until they have taken a certified training course and fully understand the risks of working on them and the correct use of all safety equipment required.”Every service operation requires written safety procedures built that all are trained on and expected to follow. “All employees need to know what to do if someone gets in trouble,” he says. “Where to touch, how to pull them off the vehicle. That’s not just an individual technician commitment, that’s a shop commitment.”\\xa0Repair NeedsMost EV repairs are similar to ICE vehicles. Both types of vehicles need air conditioning repairs, dry fluid changes, cabin air filter replacement, tire rotations and more.EVs are much heavier than ICE vehicles. For instance, a Tesla Model 3 weighs about 1,500 pounds more than a Honda Accord. This alone can increase repair needs, according to Fitzpatrick.“They are very quick cars and super torque-ey,” he explains. “When you have that much weight and that much torque, the tires get really torn up. The suspension components also take a beating. It’s something to keep in mind. There is money to be made repairing these vehicles.”\\xa0There are also diagnostic considerations when working with EVs. OPUS provides technicians with a tool and special cable set that lets them connect to their trained technicians when they have an EV diagnostic question. “They can get advice from a Tesla-certified customers which is of great value to our customers,” he says.\\xa0Whose Ready?“Few shops are ready for EV repairs,” Fitzpatrick admits. “Everyone is talking about getting involved with them, but not everyone is doing it.”But in some areas of the country the need just isn’t there yet, he explains. On Long Island repair shops see a ton of EVs. “They are absolutely mainstream here,” he says. “They are also mainstream in California.”Knowing that, Fitzpatrick recommends shops start small. “Get a charger installed in front of your shop to broadcast to customers that you’re embracing EV repair work,” he says. “Show customers that EVs are something you’re open to working on. It’s a really great calling card.”\\xa0He also recommends patience. Switching to EV repairs is a lot like when vehicles changed from timing belts. “This is just another change that we need to learn about to move forward,” he says. “The guy making a living working on ICE vehicles today will keep working on them their entire career. But they are also going to want to learn how to work on EVs.”\\xa0Fitzpatrick suggests that not every shop should pivot to EVs. “You really have to look at the makeup of the car park in your area,” he says. “If more and more of your customers are moving over to EVs, it’s definitely something you’re going to want to get on top of. EVs struggle in extreme temperatures, so consider the climate you’re in.”\\xa0Tips for Success“At the end of the day, a car is a car,” he says. “Most of the issues that have plagued ICE vehicles for years, will also be a problem with EVs. They are still going to get flat tires or need an alignment.””With that in mind, Fitzpatrick offers a few tips for a successful pivot to EV repairs.Get Trained.\\xa0“You need to be educated on what you are doing. If you take the time to build that familiarity, you’re going to be just fine,” Fitzpatrick says.Commit Funding.\\xa0The investment to repair EVs isn’t super high if the shop has kept its scan tool arsenal up to date. “It might cost you a few thousand for a fantastic toolbox on subscription,” he says. “Then it might cost another $1,000 a month for a few months for training.”Ready Your Mind.\\xa0A shift in mindset is also necessary. “Shops need to say, ‘I’m going to put politics aside and prepare to repair these vehicles,’ ” he says. “There are a lot of shops that have decided not to work on these vehicles. That is unfortunate. It is a vehicle, and it will require service. There’s money to be made here.”\\xa0 Read more aboutElectric VehiclesEV0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

Most recently, she served as CEO of KUKUI, a marketing platform provider for independent automotive repair businesses. Sharp joins Impel at a time of rapid growth following the company’s expansion into the specialty vehicle market and establishment of direct operations in the United Kingdom and Australia.Sharp has nearly 25 years of experience delivering results across the automotive aftermarket industry. Over the last two decades, she has helped independent shop owners by providing software solutions to increase repair shop productivity, responsiveness and profitability.Following Impel’s launch of Service AI for dealership service operations, the company has seen growing demand for its generative AI solutions from the independent service industry, which is primed for AI-powered automation. While customer retention is critical for independent service businesses, generating customer loyalty requires multiple touchpoints and timely outreach across the vehicle ownership lifecycle. Because independent repair shops run on tight staffing and lean infrastructure, they don’t have the time, resources or scale required to effectively conduct business outreach consistently. Impel’s generative conversational AI platform enables after-market shops to automate customer outreach, re-engagement, and scheduling by continuously mining service records and delivering personalized communications throughout the ownership lifecycle.“Impel is uniquely positioned to bring intelligent automation to the automotive aftermarket given their standing as the de facto standard for enterprise-grade AI in automotive retail,” Sharp said. “Cutting-edge AI automation is a critical need in the industry to enable profitable long-term growth at scale in lockstep with the transformation occurring in automotive manufacturing and retail. Independent shop owners can now leverage Impel’s generative conversational AI to enhance business results without adding staff or additional processes. I’m thrilled to be joining Impel and I look forward to collaborating with the team to increase the efficiency, productivity, and results for automotive aftermarket businesses everywhere.”“Impel continues to expand into new markets and verticals at a rapid pace, and the independent repair sector is an exciting new frontier with massive untapped potential that’s ripe for AI-powered lifecycle management applications and best-in-class operational solutions,” said Devin Daly, Impel CEO and co-founder. “Lorie is a proven leader with a track record of results in scaling hyper-growth businesses that deliver transformational solutions to the automotive aftermarket industry.” Read more aboutworkflow automationAbout the authorStaff WriterEditorialView Bio0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

With supply chains stable and inventories expected to achieve prepandemic normals, new-vehicle prices should fall slightly, Cox says.Used-vehicle and fixed-operations margins should continue to be robust, according to the forecast. But new-vehicle sales will have the obstacles of manufacturer suggested retail price and invoice price bumps due to supply and labor costs and more expensive models.Vehicle supplies should hit nearly three million units – triple the number during the supply-chain crisis centered on precious chips. Incentives and discounts are therefore expected to continue rising and vehicle prices falling, though moderately. But Cox doesn’t predict the record incentive levels seen in 2019, when discounting eclipsed 10% of transaction prices.It predicts less than 2% growth in new-vehicle sales this year to 15.6 million units, with the retail segment flat and fleet sales up, though by less than last year.Used-vehicle sales will also be flat at less than 1% growth to 36.2 million units, 19.2 million of that retail, Cox says.LEARN MORE: OEM Execs Share Future Views of Auto Retail Read more aboutauto salesforecastCox AutomotiveAbout the authorStaff WriterEditorialView Bio0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

Dealers need to have a strong recruitment and onboarding process that attracts top talent. You cannot understate the value of a good hiring process, as it is the first impression of your business. You don’t get a second chance to make a first impression. Once you identify and hire a candidate that you have confidence is the right person, you need to provide them with the training and support they need to be captivated and accelerate to their highest level.MORE OVERALL TRAINING AND SUPPORTThe second pillar is training, an area wherein dealerships have a need and where you can gain true benefits against your competition. Training needs to be inclusive of all aspects of the customer experience, including the overall sales process. If your staff is well trained on executing a satisfaction-worthy customer experience, your grosses will always be higher without question. Currently, the demand for vehicles is at an all-time high, which has led to a more lackadaisical approach to selling a vehicle. Right now, ask yourself, how many test drives have been missed? How many silent appraisals have been conducted? Most importantly, when is the last time you held a training event revolving around the importance of a consistent process? The normal sales process is ever evolving, and in recent years has changed considerably. The art of being proactive versus reactive in this environment is a pivotal key to your success, and remember, training is not a one-time event, it is an ongoing occurrence.IS YOUR PAY PLAN DRIVING TALENT AWAY?A motivational pay plan is our third pillar. Your pay plan needs to incentivize your team to keep them engaged while also holding everyone accountable to the performance required to achieve the goals of the dealership. This can oftentimes make or break a dealership’s success in any department. The pay plan is a key factor in any organization but specifically a sales organization. If your pay plan is focused on volume, your sales team will focus on selling as many vehicles as possible. Alternatively, if your pay plan focuses on profit, your sales team will focus on accelerating profits. A good pay plan is built whereupon your top performers are rewarded and make more money than they could elsewhere. It should also allow your average sales team members to make a comfortable income with the hopes of helping them to strive for more. High turnover rates cost dealerships a lot of time, expense, and resources, so an effective pay plan is essential. If you are suffering from turnover, you need to re-evaluate your pay plan to see if it remains competitive and effective towards reaching your goals.OVERLY SATISFYING YOUR CUSTOMERSOur fourth pillar focuses on the right products for your customers. From the vehicle inventory you keep, the F&I products offered, all the way down to the accessories available, ensure the products you are selling are appealing to what your consumers want and need. Equally important is having a staff that is fully trained and versed on these products that can answer questions appropriately. Yes, again, this means training. Customers are savvy; they need to be provided with enough information that they are comfortable to make a buying decision. Having a well-trained sales team and product information readily available in the dealership and on your website are non-negotiables.MANAGEMENT PROVIDING STABILITY AND MOTIVATIONManagement support rounds out our fifth pillar. Having an exceptional management team that works through daily activities to reach the goals of the dealership is a strong metric for success. Managers need to have a clear vision of what the dealership’s mission is and be empowered to take the necessary actions to make that possible. This should consist of a road map of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals set in place that are clearly communicated to the entire team. When selecting your management team, keep in mind not all top performers are your best candidates. They may be driven by personal success, but can they lead? Coaching your management team to be leaders is a key point often missed by organizations. Keeping open lines of communication and discussing areas of improvement through constructive criticism and team-building events are just some of the important actionable items needed to form an unstoppable management unit. If conducted correctly, managers will help your staff to develop and use their skills and abilities, keeping them engaged through interaction, and learning opportunities.OVER AND ABOVEDealers will set goals dependent of manufacturer guidelines and industry benchmarks, but many will not follow through with achieving those goals, for two simple reasons: lack of an executable action plan and support to accomplish it. Dealers can use their trusted agent partners to help create a goal structure that is realistic and flexible while also acting as an extension of your management team to hold all departments accountable.Additionally, striving to be agile, flexible, and willing to change, when necessary, will only benefit your business. The automotive industry as a whole tends to leave things alone for too long. For example, don’t be reluctant to reassess and improve a pay plan as those industry benchmarks change. Take a proactive approach instead of reactive as we discussed earlier and re-evaluate your goals often. Whether it be sales volume and profit, F&I profits and percentages, or service profits and satisfaction ratings, reevaluate these on a consistent basis throughout the year. Make sure that your business is checking every box, every month.If you are checking the boxes, there is no doubt that your dealership should be successful with retention of its customers, but the competition is fierce. Make sure your customers are having a great overall buying experience and ownership experience from their first look at your store, whether online or in person. A strong retention program and strategy is your best opportunity to obtain, retain, and resell. It’s a hot market, and inventory issues will drive customers to other stores, so make no mistake taking additional measures regarding customer service is not an option, it is a requirement.To summarize, no one pillar is more important than the other. To advance in this competitive market, a strong recruiting process to find the right people to fit your organization is the first step to forming an incredible team. Consistent, effective, and ongoing training is a must. A motivational pay plan will help to effortlessly drive results and retain key players. Along with the right products and a strong vision communicated to your management team, it’s your recipe for success.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:\\xa0Olivia Kern-Van Schoonhoven is vice president of sales for Vanguard Dealer Services.

Illustration by Mohamed Hasan via PixabayOur fourth quarter issue once again brings with it your guide to the annual Dealers’ Choice Awards. The awards are based on a survey sent to Auto Dealer Today and F&I and Showroom readers in May. The winners were announced in June and are set to accept their awards at a special ceremony held as part of Industry Summit, scheduled for Nov. 4–6 and held in New Orleans for the first time this year.The Dealers’ Choice Awards program was designed with one goal in mind: to allow dealers and dealership personnel to vote for their favorite vendors, suppliers, and finance sources and score them on the quality of the services and customer service they provide, the value received for the money you spend, and whether you would recommend them to another dealer.Read: ADT Announces Winners of 2019 Dealers’ Choice AwardsParticipation increases each year and the competition grows more intense. Each contest introduces us to several new players in a wide range of dealer-facing verticals.Every vote is a write-in vote. There is no multiple choice because that would be technically impossible. (We asked.) Examples of past winners are included with each category, but each company name still has to be manually entered, then scored.If your dealers dislike you, they will give you bad scores. If you have ever completed a DCA survey, you already know this. If you have not, and you own or work at a company you feel is deserving of a Dealers’ Choice Award, you may be wondering why you didn’t win one. We know this because we hear from curious or disappointed industry executives every year, typically within days of the big announcement.For a peek behind the DCA curtain, here are the most frequently asked questions we hear and how we answer them:How do I win an award? The Dealers’ Choice Awards are based on the results of the survey, which is open only to dealers and dealership workers. Award winners get votes and high scores for their services, customer service, value, and whether the voter would recommend them. Quality outweighs quantity.Can I campaign to win an award? The link to the survey is included in our news and promotional coverage of the awards program. Companies can and do share the link with their dealer clients. But each voter has to complete the survey themselves, no voter can vote more than once, and completed surveys are spot-checked for veracity.Is campaigning the secret to winning awards? No. If your dealers dislike you, they will give you bad scores.Will I get an award if I advertise? No. The majority of award winners are not advertisers and many winners are companies we’ve never heard of. Many of our advertisers do not win awards.Then who’s paying for this? Companies are offered the opportunity to sponsor the program after the winners are announced. And we appreciate their support.So if I win an award and sponsor the program, I’ll win again next year? Maybe! It’s not up to us.We take great pride in the program and great joy in contacting each year’s winners, of which there were 71 this year, accounting for 103 awards in 35 categories. Thanks to everyone who voted in this year’s Dealers’ Choice Awards, thanks again to our supporters, and best of luck to you all in 2020.Read: Stay in Your Lane, Mr. Dealer. We’ll Be There Too.

It suspects there may be a quarterly decrease this year for the first time in over three years.Fourth-quarter sales were up 40% year-over-year for the quarter, down from 49% in the third quarter and 52% in the fourth quarter of 2022 in a year-over-year comparison.Cox expects EVs to hit 10% U.S. market share this year, which it’s dubbed the “Year of More” for EVs – more new products, incentives, inventory, leasing and charging infrastructure – all of which it expects to increase EV sales even more.It said price parity with gas-powered models appears attainable in “coming years,” though it didn’t specify a target year. High prices are one of the main factors U.S. consumers cite for avoiding EVs. Cox said the average price for a new one was about $51,000 in December and that there were just two models under $40,000.Tesla still easily led the U.S. EV market last year with a 55% share. Though its advantage shrank by 10 percentage points, it gained strength with price cuts, Cox said.LEARN MORE: Global EV Sales to Keep Rising This Year Read more aboutElectric VehiclesCox AutomotiveAbout the authorStaff WriterEditorialView Bio0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry's Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry's Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry's Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed \"},\n",

Read the details below:Wholesale Price Changes By SegmentDecember in the wholesale market was a rollercoaster, with significant weekly declines post-Thanksgiving. Despite robust auctions and ample inventory, sellers adjusted reserve prices, seeking new pricing \"normal.\" Signs of a slowdown appeared mid-month, with declines under 2%, a notable improvement. As the holidays approached, auction activity slowed, setting the stage for a crucial final week. Retail sales success then will shape the market\\'s direction for the new year.Car SegmentInitial weeks in December saw an overall decline of -2.40%, notably with Compact Cars plummeting by a record-breaking -4.32%. As the month progressed, rates varied, with Sporty Cars accelerating the rate at -3.32%. By mid-December, the segment stabilized, experiencing a moderated decline of -1.03%, and in the final week, a further decrease of -0.51%. Premium Sporty Cars aligned with seasonal norms, while Compact Cars notably reduced depreciation to 0.30%, the lowest since late October. In the last week, no segment exceeded 1% depreciation, except for Sub-Compact Cars at -0.93%.Truck and SUV SegmentThe beginning week of the month saw a 1.64% decline, notably in Full-Size Luxury at -3.81%. By mid-December, the overall segment stabilized at -1.06%, with Minivans showing the smallest decline at -0.72%. In the final week, the decline further decreased to -0.78%, with the Compact Crossover/SUV segment at -0.48% and the Sub-Compact Luxury Crossover/SUV at -1.28%.Wholesale InventoryDecember saw significant declines in both car and truck segments, with sellers adjusting to market volatility. Auction conversion rates initially rose to 54% and later reached 56%. The second week showed a slower market decline, but auction rates dropped to 55%. In the final week, a holiday-related slowdown led to a decrease to 52%. Challenges like high-interest rates and declining used vehicle prices added uncertainty to year-end dynamics, highlighting the importance of retail sales.Used Retail ListingIn December, the Used Retail Active Listing Volume Index experienced a decline, falling to 1.00 points by the second week and remaining below the year\\'s starting point through the month. The Used Retail Days-to-Turn estimate increased from 56 to 58 days initially and further to 62 days by the mid-month, maintaining this level until the end of December.\\xa0 Read more aboutBlack Bookwholesale pricesAbout the authorStaff WriterEditorialView Bio0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email Address\\r                    Please enter a valid email address.\\r                Post\\r                Please validate that you are human.\\r            See all commentsMore From the World of Automotive Retail and Finance byThe Industry\\'s Leading Source for F&I, Sales and TechnologyThe Industry\\'s Source for Product ProvidersThe Industry\\'s Source for Automotive and Powersports AgentsDon\\'t miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.\\r                            By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.\\r                        EmailSubmit Search MenuTopicsDealer OpsDigitalComplianceFixed '},\n",
